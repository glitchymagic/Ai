# GPT Price Intent Fixes Implemented âœ…

## Summary
Fixed the "price chart at a birthday party" behavior by implementing GPT's surgical changes.

## Changes Made

### 1. âœ… Thread-Aware Prompt Fixed
**Before:** Always "add 1 stat (price/Î”%/n sales)"
**After:** Only includes stats when price intent detected

### 2. âœ… Added shouldIncludeNumbers() Guard
```javascript
shouldIncludeNumbers({ text, thread }) {
    // Price questions or selling = YES
    // Artist/social events = NO
    // Default = NO
}
```

### 3. âœ… Over-Familiarity Throttle
```javascript
shouldUseFamiliarTone(username) {
    // Requires 3+ interactions in last 30 days
    // Prevents "missed you" on first contact
}
```

### 4. âœ… Visual-First for Showcases
- If showcase + no price intent â†’ visual response only
- Bypasses strategy picker for pure social posts

### 5. âœ… Enhanced DecisionTrace
Added fields:
- `price_intent: 'present' | 'absent'`
- `suppressed_price: true | false`

## Test Results

All price intent tests pass:
- âœ… "met the artist" â†’ NO numbers
- âœ… "how much is X worth?" â†’ SHOW numbers
- âœ… "WTS $420" â†’ SHOW numbers
- âœ… "mail day showcase" â†’ NO numbers
- âœ… "top 5 cards" â†’ NO numbers

## Better Bot Response Example

**Original problematic response:**
> "missed you! That's a sick top 5. Saw the Latios/Latias â€“ insane art. Been seeing those sell for ~$40 (+15% WoW, 100+ sales)."

**New appropriate responses:**
- "That top 5 is cleanâ€”Latios/Latias goes crazy in hand. Which one ended up your #1?"
- "Meeting the artist is a W. The Lati tag-team always hitsâ€”what drew you to that one?"

## The Vibe Now

âœ… **Deterministic**: Same context â†’ same decision
âœ… **Context-aware**: Social â‰  market talk
âœ… **Data-first, not data-forced**: Numbers only when invited

No more awkward price drops at art shows! ðŸŽ¨
