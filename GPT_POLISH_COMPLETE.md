# GPT Polish Items Complete ✅

## All Three Polish Items Implemented

### 1. Event Prefix Fix ✅
**Before:** `[Poster] → Quick signal: Looks fun — what's the usual turnout?`
**After:** `[Poster] → Looks fun — what's the usual turnout?`

- Added `noPrefix` parameter to `formatPersona()`
- Event responses now pass `noPrefix: true`
- Prefix only appears for actual retail/price intents

### 2. Tidy Punctuation After Stripping ✅
**Before:** `"Moonbreon up () last"` or `"in , trending at"`
**After:** `"Moonbreon up last"` and `"in, trending at"`

Added `tidyPunctuation()` that:
- Removes empty parentheses `()`
- Fixes comma spacing
- Removes double punctuation
- Collapses multiple spaces
- Cleans up punctuation spacing

### 3. Thread Snippet Inclusion ✅
- Thread snippet now properly included when it fits
- Length check ensures total stays under 280 chars
- Only appends when thread data exists
- Safe concatenation: `${body} ${threadBit}`
