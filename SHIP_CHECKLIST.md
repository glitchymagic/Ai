## Post-Ship Monitoring

### 24h Canary Metrics

- Replies with numbers (target ‚â•70%)
- Strategy distribution (fallback <20%)
- Average time to reply (2-5 min)
- Follow-through rate

### Red Flags to Watch
- Acceptance rate <80%
- Numeric replies <60%
- Fallback strategy >30%
- Any hardcoded key alerts
- Duplicate helper warnings

## Regression Prevention

### Before Any Merge
1. Run `./merge-guard.sh`
2. Check for old patterns:
   - RNG gates (Math.random() < 0.X)
   - Raffle replies ("good luck")
   - Static dates (since:2024)
   - Loose parsing (includes('h'))
   - Hardcoded keys (AIza...)

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# Add to .github/workflows/merge-check.yml
- name: Merge Guard
  run: |
    chmod +x merge-guard.sh
    ./merge-guard.sh
```

## The aixbt Vibe ‚úÖ

**Deterministic**: Same tweet ‚Üí same strategy ‚Üí same response type
**Context-aware**: Thread scraping, visual analysis, sentiment gates
**Data-first**: Stats or precise follow-ups, no vibes-only
**Anti-scam**: Community protection with smart whitelisting

## Final Status
