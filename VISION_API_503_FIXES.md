# Vision API 503 Error Fixes ✅

## Issue Identified
The bot was encountering 503 Service Unavailable errors from the Gemini Vision API when Google's servers were overloaded. This is a temporary issue that happens during peak usage times.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Error Handling in card-recognition.js**
- Added specific handling for 503 errors
- Falls back to local LLM if available, otherwise uses text-based fallback
- Prevents the bot from crashing on service overload

### 2. **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**
- Vision API now retries up to 3 times when encountering 503 errors
- Wait times: 1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds between retries
- This gives the service time to recover from temporary overload

### 3. **Updated Key Manager**
- 503 errors no longer mark API keys as "exceeded"
- Recognizes that 503 is a temporary service issue, not a quota problem
- Keys remain available for future requests

## Current Status
✅ All 3 Gemini API keys are working properly
✅ Vision API is operational
✅ Proper fallback mechanisms in place

## How It Works Now

When a 503 error occurs:
1. **First**: Retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. **If still failing**: Fall back to local LLM (if running)
3. **Final fallback**: Use text-based analysis (no vision)

The bot will continue to function even during Gemini service outages, though with reduced vision capabilities.

## Recommendations
- The 503 errors are temporary and usually resolve within minutes
- No action needed - the bot will handle these automatically
- Consider running LM Studio as a backup for better fallback responses
