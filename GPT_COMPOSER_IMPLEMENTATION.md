# GPT Composer Implementation Complete

## New Features Added

### 1. Intent Engine (`features/intent-engine.js`)
- Lightweight, fuzzy intent classification
- Detects: retail, price, grading, pack_opening, pull_rates, vintage_modern
- No ML required, uses keyword matching with weights

### 2. Event Detector (`features/event-detector.js`)
- Detects tournament/event posts vs card showcases
- Looks for: day of week, time, entry fee, address, tournament keywords
- Requires 2+ signals to classify as event

### 3. Thread Snippet Builder (`features/thread-snippet.js`)
- Builds non-hallucinated thread context
- Shows last 3 messages before current
- Only includes real data, never infers

### 4. Persona Styler (`features/persona-style.js`)
- Consistent voice formatting
- Adds "Quick signal:" prefix for price/retail intents
- Removed confidence tags for production

### 5. Response Composer (`features/response-composer.js`)
- Blends authority + thread context
- Event mode: social responses, no prices
- General mode: authority-first with thread snippet

## Integration Changes

### Modified `generateContextualResponse`:

1. **Event Detection**: Checks if post is about tournament/event
2. **Thread Context**: Builds snippet from real conversation data
3. **Composed Responses**: 
   - Events get "Looks fun — what's the usual turnout?"
   - Others get authority response + thread snippet
4. **Price Stripping**: Removes prices when `numbersOk=false` or for events
5. **Fallback Safety**: Always returns non-null authority response

## Key Improvements

### 1. No More Thread Hallucination
- Thread claims only made when actual thread exists (depth >= 2)
- Thread snippet built from real conversation data only

### 2. Event vs Card Detection
- Tournament posters get social responses
- No prices injected into event discussions
- Example: "Tuesdays 6PM • $10 entry" → social response

### 3. Authority Never Null
- Composer ensures authority always returns something
- Fallback: "Focus on centering/surfaces; solds > listings."
- Thread-aware can't bypass expertise

### 4. Deterministic & Safe
- No RNG in any decision paths
- Intent classification is deterministic
- Event detection uses clear signals

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Event Post**: "Tournament Tuesdays 6PM, $10 entry at Santa Fe Mall"
   - Response: "Looks fun — what's the usual turnout? [conf:70]"
   
2. **Price Question**: "What's moonbreon worth?"
   - Response: Uses existing price engine if numbersOk=true
   
3. **Card Showcase**: Image of cards without price intent
   - Response: Authority insight, no forced numbers
   
4. **Thread Reply**: Deep conversation
   - Response: Authority + thread snippet showing previous messages

## Production Notes

- Confidence tags removed from output
- All responses clamped to 280 chars
- Price responses only when explicitly asked AND numbersOk=true
- Events never get price data regardless of intent
