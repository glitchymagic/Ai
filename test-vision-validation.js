Be very specific. If it's an event poster, DO NOT identify any Pokemon cards.
If you see a Pokemon character on a poster, that's part of the poster design, not a card.

CRITICAL: Event posters often have Pokemon characters (like Chikorita) as mascots. These are NOT cards!
Only identify something as a card if you see an actual Pokemon TCG card with HP, attacks, etc.

For this image, determine:
- Is this an EVENT POSTER? (has date, time, entry fee, location)
- Is this a CARD? (has HP, attacks, card number)
- What Pokemon character appears? (mascot on poster vs actual card)
