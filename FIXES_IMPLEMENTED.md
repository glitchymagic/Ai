# Bot Response Enhancement Fixes

## Summary
Fixed the bot's generic response issue by improving strategy selection and enhancing authority responses with specific TCG knowledge.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Strategy Picker Enhancements
- **Fixed**: Price questions now always trigger price strategy (not just when stats available)
- **Fixed**: Lowered authority strategy threshold from valueScore >= 5 to >= 3
- **Added**: Fallback to authority strategy for any detected Pokemon content
- **Result**: Bot now properly selects appropriate strategies instead of defaulting to fallback

### 2. Authority Response Improvements
- **Enhanced**: Added more Pokemon TCG terms for detection (vmax, vstar, ex, gx, alt art, etc.)
- **Added**: Specific responses for common scenarios:
  - Pull discussions: "Pull rates vary by set - ES sits around 1:12 for V/VMAX"
  - Retail hunting: "Retail restocks typically Tuesday mornings"
  - Pack opening: "Pack mapping's dead on modern sets"
  - Collections: "Side-loading pages protect corners better"
- **Enhanced**: Market insights with specific data points and trends
- **Added**: Card-specific insights (Charizard tax, Moonbreon dominance, etc.)
- **Result**: Responses now demonstrate real TCG expertise

### 3. Price Strategy Enhancement
- **Fixed**: Price strategy now attempts to fetch prices even without stats
- **Added**: Fallback to enhanced price responses for specific cards
- **Improved**: Better handling of price questions with incomplete information
- **Result**: More helpful price responses instead of generic "need more info"

### 4. Visual Analyzer Updates (Previously Completed)
- **Enhanced**: Response templates with TCG-specific knowledge
- **Fixed**: Event poster detection
- **Added**: Grading insights and market commentary
- **Result**: Visual responses show expertise instead of generic comments

## Testing Results
- Strategy picker correctly identifies price questions and Pokemon content
- Authority responses provide specific, knowledgeable insights
- Price responses attempt to be helpful even with limited information
- Overall bot responses are now specific and demonstrate expertise

## Next Steps
1. Monitor bot performance with enhanced responses
2. Collect user feedback on response quality
3. Fine-tune thresholds based on real-world performance
