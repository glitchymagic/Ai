# Gemini API Key Status Summary

## Current Status (as of testing):

### Key 1: AIzaSyD9Hl53GRtWyZyQCgrfPDuYljIHEulIKcw
- **Status**: ❌ QUOTA EXCEEDED
- **Issue**: Hit the 50 requests/day free tier limit
- **Valid**: Yes, the key is valid but exhausted

### Key 2: AIzaSyClg-pgWQpAny17vRbiWokCC7L_YjEFkQ  
- **Status**: ❌ INVALID
- **Issue**: API key not recognized by Google
- **Valid**: No, this key is completely invalid (400 Bad Request)
- **Note**: This was never a working key or has been deleted/revoked

### Key 3: AIzaSyDnlBhkg5GO2O85O-bfVcyCnGa29boEUh8
- **Status**: ❌ QUOTA EXCEEDED  
- **Issue**: Hit the 50 requests/day free tier limit
- **Valid**: Yes, the key is valid but exhausted

## Summary:
- **Total Keys**: 3
- **Working Keys**: 2 (Keys 1 and 3)
- **Invalid Keys**: 1 (Key 2)
- **Available Quota**: 0 (both working keys exhausted)

## Why Keys Exhausted So Quickly:

1. **Multiple API calls per engagement**:
   - Vision API: 1 call per image (posts often have 4 images = 4 calls)
   - Video analysis: 5 calls per video (analyzing 5 frames)
   - Thread response: 1 call per response
   - Total: Up to 10 API calls for a single post with video

2. **Memory leak bug**: Earlier infinite loop made hundreds of failed API calls

3. **Low free tier limit**: Only 50 requests per key per day
   - With 2 working keys = 100 total requests
   - At 10 requests per post = only ~10 posts can be processed

## Recommendations:

1. **Immediate**: Replace the invalid Key 2 with a new working API key

2. **Reduce API usage**:
   - Analyze only 1-2 frames for videos instead of 5
   - Batch multiple images into single API calls
   - Skip vision analysis for low-priority posts
   - Cache vision results to avoid re-analyzing

3. **Better key rotation**:
   - Track exact usage per key
   - Save remaining quota between bot runs
   - Switch keys more intelligently

4. **Long term**: Consider paid Gemini API tier for higher limits
